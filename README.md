# Generator Functions
This repository contains research and tools for a paper in progress: "Deriving Sequence Generation Functions via Sequence Derivatives."

**Work in progress**

Repo organization: 
+ Code: haskell implementation of the mathematics.  
    + **commonFn.hs** - Common functions used in the codebase. 
    + **gen.hs** - An implementation of the generation function learner. 
    + **seq.hs** - A bunch of code for creating different types of sequences. 
    + **seqFamilies.hs** - An implementation of the sequence group learner. 
+ Notebooks: ipython interactive notebooks for exploring the topic. 
+ PaperLatex: latex and assorted files for compiling the paper. 
+ Tools: web applications for visualizing the numbers and patterns associated with the work.
